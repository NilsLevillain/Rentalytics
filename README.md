# Rentalytics

## Overview
'Rentalytics' is an analytics project aimed at identifying the top 10 most profitable flats for investment within a specific area. The goal is to determine which flats are the best candidates for purchase, renovation, and resale at a higher price.

## Features
- **Location Analysis**: Evaluates the desirability of a location based on amenities, public transport, schools, and crime rates.
- **Market Trends**: Analyzes historical price trends to forecast potential increases in property value.
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Calculates the expected ROI, factoring in purchase, renovation, holding, and selling costs.
- **Demand Analysis**: Assesses rental demand to gauge rental income potential and the ease of selling post-renovation.
- **Comparative Market Analysis (CMA)**: Compares similar properties to ensure competitive pricing after renovation.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies risks such as market volatility, unexpected costs, or policy changes impacting real estate.

## Future Evolutions
- Enhance location analysis algorithms for more accurate desirability metrics.
- Integrate advanced predictive models for market trend analysis.
- Develop a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis tool to streamline ROI calculations.
- Implement a demand analysis feature to monitor real-time rental market demand.
